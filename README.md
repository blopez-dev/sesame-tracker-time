# Sesame HR. Pablo J. García

This is a project created for SESAME HR by Pablo J. García.

## The improvements I would have liked to make if I had more time are:

- As the main improvement, I would have liked to have implemented the basic testing flow, 
which I didn't have time to create, although the configuration for it has been added.

- Do a better search solution for more optimal results.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies by running the command: `pnpm install`
2. Start the development server by running the command: `pnpm run dev`
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` to view the application.


## Project considerations:

1. The project has been developed using the Vue.js library, utilizing the vue-cli tool to set up its structure. 
2. Development has been carried out using version 3 of Vue.js, with the Composition API as the reference. 
3. For state management, essential for tracking clock-ins, clock-outs, and worker data, Pinia has been chosen as the tool for setting up the store.
